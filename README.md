# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
We assisted a Colorado Board of Elections employee in analyzing the outcome of the congressional election via an election audit. The analysis was performed in order to determine the election winner. We also assisted the Board further by analyzing the voter turnout for each county (Arapahoe, Denver, and Jefferson), the percentage of votes from each county out of the total vote count, and the county with the highest voting turnout.

## Election Audit Summary
This project resulted in a very useful script that can easily be used to analyze results of other elections, or to further analyze this election's results. We could modify the script to provide us with the number of votes each candidate received from each county. We could use this script to analyze a presidential election, for example, by modifying the script to provide us with the total number of votes and number of voters for each candidate per state, city, or county.
